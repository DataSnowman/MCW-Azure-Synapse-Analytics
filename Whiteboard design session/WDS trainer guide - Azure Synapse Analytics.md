# Trainer information

Thank you for taking time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

-   Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.

-   Stimulates the participant's thinking.

-   Involves the participant in the learning process.

-   Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).

-   Ensures individual participant accountability.

-   Ties it all together for the participant.

-   Provides insight and experience to the learning process.

-   Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.

-   Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables.

-   Effectively leads the feedback process.

## Whiteboard design session flow 

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

-   Customer's background, situation, needs and technical requirements

-   Current customer infrastructure and architecture

-   Potential issues, objectives and blockers

**Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution (60 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

-   Determine your target customer audience.

-   Determine customer's business needs to address your solution.

-   Design and diagram your solution.

-   Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to your customer:

-   Present solution

-   Respond to customer objections

-   Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

-   Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

-   Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

-   Become familiar with all key points and activities.

-   Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

-   Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

-   Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

-   **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

-   **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

-   **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

## Abstract and learning objectives 

\[insert what is trying to be solved for by using this workshop. . . \]

## Step 1: Review the customer case study 

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions:  With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1.  Meet your table participants and trainer.

2.  Read all of the directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3.  As a table team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Wide World Importers, WWI, has hundreds of brick and mortar stores and an online store where they sell a variety of products. 

WWI believes that data is the oxygen of retail. Retail has never been short of data, but they have not been able to maximize the value of this data. They struggle with gragmented data and a lack of understanding of customer behavior and expectations and believe that a successful customer experience strategy is founded upon the effective use of data. 

They believe that using analytics on top of retail data has the potential to unlock ways for them to improve personalized, omni-channel campaigns that engage potential and existing customers across their buying journey. 

They would like to combine their retail lifecycle data including customer data, operations data, sourcing and supplier data as well as transaction data with analytics to reduce churn, enhance loyalty, advance customer journeys, enable the ability to conduct contextual marketing, measure attribution and provide insights across their enterprise to holistically drive growth across the organization. 

They would like to use historical campaign and customer analytics data and make decisions for the present.
And even more exciting, they would like to use real-time streaming data from Twitter as well as from IoT sensors in their brick and mortar locations. They would like to use data from the present moment to take decisions for the next moment.
Then finally, they would like to use their data to predict the future â like product recommendations and numbers of visitors to stores.

According to Peter Guerin, Chief Technical Officer (CTO), Wide World Importers has over 5 years of sales transaction data from Oracle, consisting of more than 26 billion rows. But that is not their only enteprise data source. They have finance data stored in SAP Hana, marketing data in Teradata and social media data coming in from Twitter. They need a solution that allows them to integrate, query over and analyze the data from all of these sources. Additionally, regardless of the volume, they want to be able queries across such data with results returning in seconds.

In addition to those data sources, they have in-store IoT sensors producing telemetry data that tracks the traffic patterns of customers walking the aisles. Each store has 50 sensors, and they have 100 stores equipped to provide this real-time data. Using this data they want to understand in which departments (or groups of aisles) people are spending most of their time, and which of those they are not. They would like a solution to ensure that this data gets ingested and processed in near real time, allowing them to quickly identify patterns that can be shared between stores. For example, as stores open on the East Coast, patterns detected in early buying behavior could inform last minute offers and in store product placement of products in their West Coast stores that have yet to open.

WWI does not want to have to rely on specialists to create data ingest and data transformation pipelines. They would like to split the problem into two efforts: 
    * land data from new data sources in their data lake
    * preparing, merging and transforming data for querying from the data warehouse
They would like to accomplish both using tools that simplify the building of these transformation pipelines using a graphical designer, only dropping down into code when absolutely necessary.

Peter also mentioned, that in his experience a point of frustration with the tools was how much setup was required before any preliminary exploratory data analysis could be performed. So he would prefer a solution that allows WWI to quickly explore the raw ingested data to understand its contents?

To bring their entire operation into perspective, Wide World Importers would like to create a dashboard where they can see their KPI's derived from historical data, real-time twitter sentiment and sensor data, and key product recommendations generated using machine learning.


### Customer needs 

1.  Gain business insights using a combination of historical, real-time, and predictive analytics. 

2.  Have a unified approach to handling their structured and unstructured data sources.

3.  Enable their team of data engineers and data scientists to bring in and run complex queries over petabytes of structured data with billions of rows and unstructured enterprise operational data.

4.  Enable business analysts and data science/data engineering teams to share a single source of truth. 

5.  They would like to minimize the number of disparate services they use across ingest, transformation, querying and storage, so that their team of data engineers, data scientists and database administrators can master one tool, and can build shared best practices for development, management and monitoring.

6.  Prefer to accomplish this working withing a single collaborative environment.

7.  They have concerns about performance, and want to make sure they can understand the core approaches they should take to ensure the best performance of the solution recommended.

8.  Need a solution that provides a consistent security model across all components.


### Customer objections 

1.  WWI does not want to have to rely on specialists to create data ingest and data transformation pipelines  using tools that simplify the building of transformation pipelines using a graphical designer.

2.  WWI understands that Azure offers several services with overlapping capabilities- they do not want to spend the time stitching them together to get to the desired analytics solution. 

3.  The have seen demos from competing systems that claim to load massive datasets in seconds. Does Azure offer such a solution?

4.  They have heard of serverless querying, does your solution offer this? Does it support querying the data at the scale of WWI and what formats does it support? Would this be appropriate for supporting their dashboards or reports?

# Azure Synapse Analytics whiteboard design session trainer guide

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

-   Check in with your table participants to introduce yourself as the trainer.

-   Ask, "What questions do you have about the customer case study?"

-   Briefly review the steps and timeframes of the whiteboard design session.

-   Ready, set, go! Let the table participants begin.

## Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

-   Check in with your tables to ensure that they are transitioning from step to step on time.

-   Provide some feedback on their responses to the business needs and design.

    -   Try asking questions first that will lead the participants to discover the answers on their own.

-   Provide feedback for their responses to the customer's objections.

    -   Try asking questions first that will lead the participants to discover the answers on their own.

## Step 3: Present the solution

-   Determine which table will be paired with your table before Step 3 begins.

-   For the first round, assign one table as the presenting team and the other table as the customer.

-   Have the presenting team present their solution to the customer team.

    -   Have the customer team provide one objection for the presenting team to respond to.

    -   The presentation, objections, and feedback should take no longer than 15 minutes.

    -   If needed, the trainer may also provide feedback.

## Wrap-up

-   Have the table participants reconvene with the larger session group to hear the facilitator/SME share the following preferred solution.

##  Preferred target audience

Peter Guerin, Chief Technical Officer (CTO), World Wide Importers.

The primary audience is the business decision makers and technology decision makers. From the case study scenario, this includes Peter Guerin, CTO of WWI. Usually we talk to the infrastructure managers who report to the chief information officers (CIOs), or to application sponsors (like a vice president [VP] line of business [LOB], or chief marketing officer [CMO]), or to those who represent the business unit IT or developers that report to application sponsors.

## Preferred solution

**High Level Architecture**
*	Diagram your initial vision for handling the top-level requirements for data loading, data transformation, storage, machine learning modeling, and reporting.

**Ingest & Store**

*	For the solution you recommend, what specific approach is the most performant for moving flat file data from the ingest storage locations to the data lake? 
    * Follow pattern of landing in lake first, then ingest into warehouse. Extract using ADF, as Parquet files.
*	What storage service would you recommend they use and how would you recommend they structure the folders so they can manage the data at the various levels of refinement?
    * ADLS gen 2; example structure: bronze, silver, gold, platinum containers.
*	When it comes to ingesting raw data in batch from new data sources, what data formats could they support with your solution?
    * CSV, Parquet, ORC, JSON  
*	How will you ingest streaming data from the in-store IoT devices?
    *   Collect in Event Hub or IoT Hub, process with Stream Analytics **(Confirm this is recommendation for April timeframe)**.

**Transform**
*	Before building transformation pipelines or loading it into the data warehouse, how can WWI quickly explore the raw ingested data to understand its contents?
    *   Using Studio, right click to query a SQL or as DataFrame in a notebook.
*	When it comes to storing refined versions of the data for possible querying, what data format would you recommend they use? Why?
    *   Parquet. There is industry alignment around Parquet format for sharing (e.g., across Hadoop, Databricks, and SQL engine scenarios) data at the storage layer. In addition to Azure Synapse Analytics, Parquet is supported by other services, such as Power BI. Parquet is a perfomant, column oriented format optimized for big data scenarios. 
*	Regarding the service you recommend they use for preparing, merging and transforming the data, in which situations can you use the graphical designer and which situations would require code? 
    * The could use Mapping Data Flows that they graphically design in Studio. These code-free data flows provide for scalable execution which builds DSL for transformation, into code that runs on Spark, which runs at scale and provides elasticity for handling growing volumes of data. 
    * They can use code when their data engineers want to use Spark to transform the data via DataFrames. 
*	Their data team is accustomed to leveraging open source packages that help them quickly pre-process the data, as well as enable their data scientists to train machine learning models using both Spark and python. Explain how your solution would enable this.
    *  Synapse support open source Apache Spark and the execution of Python, Scala and (in the near future) R code. Their data team would be able to use the familiar Jupyter notebooks and leverage their favorite libraries.
*	Does your solution allow their data engineers and data scientists to work within Jupyter notebooks? How are libraries managed?
    *  Apache Spark pools allow the importing of libraries during creation.
    *  These dependencies are specified using a PIP freeze formatted document listing the desired library name and version.
    *  The data team can then launch notebooks attached to the Spark pool and author the code that uses their favorite libraries.  


**Query**
*	Their sales transaction dataset exceeds a billion rows. For their downstream reporting queries, they need to be able to join, project and filter these rows in no longer than 10s of seconds. WWI is concerned their data is just to big to do this. 
    * What specific indexing techniques should they use to reach this kind of performance for their fact tables? Why?
      * Clustered Columnstore Indexes. As they offer the highest level of data compression and best overall query performance, columnstore indexes are usually the best choice for large tables such as fact tables. 
    * Would you recommend the same approach for tables they have with less than 100 million rows?
      * No. For "small" tables with less than 100 million rows, they should consider Heap tables.
    * How should they configure indexes on their smaller lookup tables (e.g., those that contain store names and addresses)?
      * The should consider using Heap tables. For small lookup tables, less than 100 million rows, often heap tables make sense. Cluster columnstore tables begin to achieve optimal compression once there is more than 100 million rows.
    * What would you suggest for their larger lookup tables that are used just for point lookups that retrieve only a single row? How could they makes these more flexible so that queries filtering against different sets of columns would still yield performant lookups?
      * Use clustered indexes. Clustered indexes may outperform clustered columnstore tables when a single row needs to be quickly retrieved. For queries where a single or very few row lookup is required to performance with extreme speed, consider a cluster index or nonclustered secondary index. The disadvantage to using a clustered index is that only queries that benefit are the ones that use a highly selective filter on the clustered index column. To improve filter on other columns a nonclustered index can be added to other columns. However, each index which is added to a table adds both space and processing time to loads.

    * What should they use for the fastest loading of staging tables?
      * A heap table. If you are loading data only to stage it before running more transformations, loading the table to heap table is much faster than loading the data to a clustered columnstore table. 
      * In addition, loading data to aÂ temporary tableÂ loads faster than loading a table to permanent storage.
*	What are the typical issues they should look out for with regards to **distributed** table design for the following scenarios? 
    * Their smallest fact table exceeds several GBâs and by their nature experiences frequent inserts. 
      * They should use a hash distribution. 
      * A hash-distributed table distributes table rows across the Compute nodes by using a deterministic hash function to assign each row to oneÂ distribution.
      * Since identical values always hash to the same distribution, the data warehouse has built-in knowledge of the row locations. SQL Data Warehouse uses this knowledge to minimize data movement during queries, which improves query performance.
      * Hash-distributed tables work well for large fact tables in a star schema. They can have very large numbers of rows and still achieve high performance. 
      * Consider using a hash-distributed table when:
        - The table size on disk is more than 2 GB.
        - The table has frequent insert, update, and delete operations.
    * As they develop the data warehouse, the WWI data team identified some tables created from the raw input that might be useful, but they donât currently join to other tables and they are not sure of the best columns they should use for distributing the data. 
      * They should consider round-robin distribution.
      * A round-robin distributed table distributes table rows evenly across all distributions. The assignment of rows to distributions is random. Unlike hash-distributed tables, rows with equal values are not guaranteed to be assigned to the same distribution.
      * As a result, the system sometimes needs to invoke a data movement operation to better organize your data before it can resolve a query. This extra step can slow down your queries. For example, joining a round-robin table usually requires reshuffling the rows, which is a performance hit.
      * Consider using the round-robin distribution for your table in the following scenarios:
            
          * When getting started as a simple starting point since  it is the default
          * If there is no obvious joining key
          * If there is not good candidate column for hash distributing the table
          * If the table does not share a common join key with other tables
          * If the join is less significant than other joins in the query
            When the table is a temporary staging table

    * Their data engineers sometimes use temporary staging tables in their data preparation. 
      * The should use a round-robin distibuted table.
    * They have lookup tables that range from several hundred MBs to 1.5 GBs.
      * The should consider using replicated tables.
      * A replicated table has a full copy of the table accessible on each Compute node. Replicating a table removes the need to transfer data among Compute nodes before a join or aggregation. Since the table has multiple copies, replicated tables work best when the table size is less than 2 GB compressed.

*	Some of their data contains columns in the JSON format, how could they flatten these hierarchical fields to a tabular structure? 
    * The can use SQL on-demand along with the T-SQL OPENJSON, JSON_VALUE, and JSON_QUERY statements.
*	What approach can they use to update the JSON data?
    * The can use JSON_MODIFY with the UPDATE statement. 
*	In some of their queries, they are OK trading off speed of returning counts for a small reduction in accuracy. How might they do this?
  * They should use the APPROXIMATE_COUNT_DISTINCT statement which uses the HyperLogLog to return a result with an average 2% accuracy of the true cardinality. For example, if COUNT(DISTINCT) returns 1,000,000, then with approximate execution you will get a value between 999,736 to 1,016,234.
*	Many of their downstream reports are used by many users, which often means the same query is being executed repeatedly against data that does not change that often. What can WWI to improve the performance of these types of queries? How does this approach work when the underlying data changes?
    * They should consider result-set caching. 
    * Cache the results of a query in SQL pool storage. This enables interactive response times for repetitive queries against tables with infrequent data changes.
    * The result-set cache persists even if SQL pool is paused and resumed later. 
    * Query cache is invalidated and refreshed when underlying table data or query code changes.
    * Result cache is evicted regularly based on a time-aware least recently used algorithm (TLRU). 



**Visualize**
*	What product can WWI use to visualize their retail transaction data? Is it a separate tool that they need to install? 
  * They can create, edit and view Power BI reports directly within the Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.
*	Can they use this same tool visualize both the batch and streaming data in a single dashboard view?
    * Yes. Power BI can be used to create dashboard that visualize both kinds of data.
*	With the product you recommend, do they need to load all the data into the data warehouse before they can create reports against it?
    * No, they only need to load the data into storage. Using SQL On-demand and Power BI they can create reports against the data directly.


**Manage & Secure**
*	In previous efforts, WWI systems struggled with their popularity. Exploratory queries that were not time sensitive would saturate the available resources and delay the execution of higher priority queries supporting critical reports. Explain how your solution helps to resolve this. 
    * Workload Management.
    * It manages resources, ensures highly efficient resource utilization, and maximizes return on investment (ROI). 
    * The three pillars of workload management are
      * Workload Classification â To assign a request to a workload group and setting importance levels.
    * Workload Importance â To influence the order in which a request gets access to resources.
    * Workload Isolation â To reserve resources for a workload group.

*	What does your solution provide to WWI to help them identify issues such as suboptimal table distribution, data skew, cache misses, tempdb contention and suboptimal plan selection?
  * They can leverage the Azure Advisor recommendations.
*	WWI recognizes there is a balance between the data warehouse software staying up to date and when they can afford downtime that might result. How can they establish their preferences with your solution so they are never caught off guard with an upgrade?
    * They should leverage maintenance windows. 
    * Choose a time window for your upgrades.
    * Select a primary and secondary window within a seven-day period.
    * Windows can be from 3 to 8 hours.
    * 24-hour advance notification for maintenance events.
    * Benfits include: Ensure upgrades happen on your schedule; Predictable planning for long-running jobs; Stay informed of start and end of maintenance.

*	How does your solution provide security across both SQL and Spark workloads? 
    * [TODO]
*	Can the solution help WWI discover, track and remediate security misconfigurations and detect threats? How?
    * [TODO]
*	Can WWI use this same solution to monitor for sensitive information by enabling them to discover, classify and protect and track access to such data?
    * [TODO]
*	From a network security standpoint, how is your solution secured?
    * [TODO]
